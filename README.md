# Save to Run

Python script to run other python scripts on `Ctrl-S`. A (subjectively) better alternative for coding experiments to Python's interactive console. Inspired by [jarvis](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/jarvis). Written while waiting for [LightTable](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ibdknox/light-table) release.

Usage:

```
save2run.py script-to-execute.py
```

Included `save2run.bat` script executes `save2.run.py` within
[Console](http://sourceforge.net/projects/console/) window:

```
save2run script-to-execute.py
```

### TODO

* Argument: Clear screen before execute.
* Argument: Enable/disable timestamp output for each execution.
